# About Me
Hi, I'm Irfan. I'm a game developer, and I mostly work on solo projects because I don't really like other people touching my work so yeah, fuck around and find out.
I mainly work with the Roblox engine since it's really easy to use. I'm still learning Unity because I want to explore more game engines.<br><br>
