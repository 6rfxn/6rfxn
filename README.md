# About Me

Hi, I’m Irfan. I’m a game developer, and I mostly work on solo projects because I don't really like other people touching my work — so yeah, fuck around and find out.
I mainly work with the Roblox engine since it’s really easy to use. I’m still learning Unity because I want to explore more game engines.<br><br>

### Here’s a list of the projects I’m currently working on:
